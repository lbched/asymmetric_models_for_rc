# **Code for "Asymmetric Models for Realized Covariances"**

Luc Bauwens, Emilija Dzuverovic, Christian Hafner

## Overview

The code in this repository is used in the empirical analyses of the paper ''Asymmetric Models for Realized Covariances". The latter were run on Matlab_R2024b, including the adoption of the MFE Toolbox of Kevin Sheppard.

The main contents of the source code are the following:
- Estimation_Tables.m: the script file leading to the main estimation results
- Forecasting_Tables.m: the script file leading to the main forecasting results
- Fun/: folders of the functions for generating the estimation and forecasting results
- Data/: folders of processed data files used as an input for generating the estimation and forecasting results
- Forecasts/: folder of processed data files used as an input for generating the forecasting results

## Instructions

The estimtion and forecasting analyses files can be run individually, in any order. Remember to specify the correct path to the local version of the repository.

## Data availability

### Solar Flare Forecasts
The prepared forecast-observation data are located at data/C1_flares.rda and data/M1_flares.rda, for the classes C1.0+ and M1.0+ of solar flare intensity. These files are generated by the script data-raw/prepare_SolarFlares.R using the pre-processed data files SF.FC.C1.rda and SF.FC.M1.rda from Dimitriadis and Jordan (2021, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4699945). That replication package contains a description of the pre-processing of the original data on solar flares from Leka and Park (2019, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HYP74O).

### SPF Forecasts for Economic Recessions
The prepared forecast-observation data are located at data/spf.gpd.long.rda. They are also available from Dimitriadis and Jordan (2021, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4699945), a replication package that contains a description of the pre-processing of the original data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/).

### Fragile Family Challenge
The Fragile Family Challenge (FFC) is a scientific mass collaboration where 160 teams built predictions for six variables, where we analyze two binary ones (eviction and job training). The prepared forecast and outcome data are located in the data/ folder, as files FFC_Eviction.rda and FFC_JobTraining.rda.

The forecasts (submissions) of the 160 teams together with the realizations originate from Salganik et al (2020, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CXSECU), located in the data/derived/submissions.csv.zip file. The 9 benchmark forecasts have to be generated separately by obtaining data files from https://opr.princeton.edu/archive/ as described in Salganik et al (2020). We prepare the FFC data using these two (in this repository unavailable) files within the script prepare_FragileFamilyChallenge.R.
